# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

The idea of this project was to take an already developed webpage and make two improvements:
making the code more presentable and easier to work with, and adding some accessibility 
features. Specifically, alt text was added to images on the webpage, and the index.html 
and style.css pages were cleaned up with some proper syntax such as grouping identical 
classes, and making the HTML more easily readable.

The primary issue I ran into with this project, and is still present, is whether or not
the first image under the "hero" div is, or even can, have alt text added. Based on 
what I found online, adding alt text to a div will not function with a screen reader,
and any attempts I made at adjusting the element did not function as I wanted. 

Through some research I was able to find a lot of syntax adjustments I could make to
make the overall code a lot more presentable. Namely, grouping and alphabetising the
CSS ids and classes, and common practices for organising the HTML elements.
